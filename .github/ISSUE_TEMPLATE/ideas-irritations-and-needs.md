<!-- There are _many_ different frameworks for describing problems and ideas, feel free to use a framework you are already used to, otherwise use the following prompts to guide you-->

## Who is your user?

<!-- describe the broad class of user rather than an individual i.e. contributors to multiple collectives-->

## What are they trying to achieve?

<!-- try not to describe a solution, try to describe what they are _ultimately_ trying to achieve i.e. file a tax return. Feel free to use the following as a template.-->

_When <situation>, I want to <motivation>, so I can <outcome>_

## How are they currently doing this?

<!-- problems with workarounds already followed are likely to have a greater need for the individual. -->

## How well understood is this problem?

<!-- tick the box that best describes how you feel about this problem -->

- [ ] Surfacing: if you feel this is a seed of an idea that needs to be researched.
- [ ] Understanding: if you've done some research and feel it is already well understood and ready for shaping.
- [ ] Shaping: if you feel a solution is clearly defined and can be made into a pitch ([read more about shaping](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.1-chapter-02))
- [ ] Pitching: if you feel that it is ready to be presented for prioritisation ([read more about pitching](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.5-chapter-06))
